# HypnoNeuro Core Engine

🧠 **System Architecture by Dr. Meg Montañez Davenport**  
This repository contains the core codebase and architecture powering the HypnoNeuro platform — a Web3-enabled mental wellness game that integrates behavioral neuroscience, tokenized therapy incentives, and trauma-informed healing protocols.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

HypnoNeuro is a decentralized mental wellness platform that merges naturopathic psychology with digital therapeutics. The core engine is designed to:

- Deliver gamified therapy through behavioral loops
- Track emotional regulation and session milestones
- Integrate wallet-based access and token/NFT rewards
- Enable secure, pseudonymous mental health support

This repo includes foundational code and logic for:
- Smart contract triggers
- Session progression and state logic
- Wallet + MetaMask integration
- Token redemption infrastructure

## 🤝 Acknowledgements

This codebase was built in collaboration with developer **Nadeem Shahzad**, based on the original system architecture, healing logic, and token/NFT reward structures created by **Dr Meg Montañez Davenport**.

All intellectual property and strategic design belong to the **HypnoNeuro platform**.  
Development was supported under contract as part of the platform’s private R&D build.

## 🚧 Status

Phase 1 complete — Phase 2 (contract integration + NFT automation) pending.  
Looking for collaborators in blockchain, data science, and decentralized health.
